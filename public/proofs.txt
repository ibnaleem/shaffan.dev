Any accounts with my name (Shaffan Aleem) or GitHub username (ibnaleem) that are not stated in this file DO NOT belong to me. Impersonation is easy, do not be fooled. Unless I explicitly state it in this file, the account DOES NOT belong to me.

If this file does not yield a valid signature, disregard the above and assume they are compromised. If the signature is valid, then I am alive and in full control of my accounts. If the signature is valid but I have not updated this file in three months or longer, then I am dead.

Previously, this file was always signed by my PGP key 6226 9234 9ABB 56F6 B520 ED41 7A74 9DC5 D8A4 58B8. However, I've decided to dedicate another key 0DA7 C4BF 8D72 DC90 CDD3 CB45 FBB9 1670 5544 F13E for this purpose. This key will expire 03 March 2026.
