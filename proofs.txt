I hereby confirm that I, Shaffan Aleem, am alive and in full control:

1. of my domain shaffan.dev (shaffan dot dev) and it's DNS records, which can be verified with the command (dig shaffan.dev TXT ; dig _keybase.shaffan.dev TXT) | grep keybase

2. of my github account, which can be verified @ https://gist.github.com/ibnaleem/bae8c71b65acdf88eaab1214ae022538

3. of my keybase account, found @ https://keybase.io/ibnaleem

4. of the contents of my website hosted @ https://github.com/ibnaleem/shaffan.dev, with each commit signed with my GPG key 2024 7EC0 23F2 769E 6618 1C0F 581B 4A2A 862B BADE

5. of the GPG keys hosted @ shaffan.dev/pgp.txt:
5.1 2024 7EC0 23F2 769E 6618 1C0F 581B 4A2A 862B BADE
5.2 6226 9234 9ABB 56F6 B520 ED41 7A74 9DC5 D8A4 58B8

6. of my email addresses ibnaleem@outlook.com, shaffanaleem@hotmail.com and root@shaffan.dev

Any accounts with my name (Shaffan Aleem) or GitHub username (ibnaleem) that are not stated in this file DO NOT belong to me. Impersonation is easy, do not be fooled. Unless I explicitly state it in this file, the account DOES NOT belong to me.

If this file does not yield a valid signature, disregard the above and assume they are compromised. If the signature is valid, then I am alive and in full control of my accounts. If the signature is valid but I have not updated this file in three months or longer, then I am dead.

Previously, this file was always signed by my GPG key 6226 9234 9ABB 56F6 B520 ED41 7A74 9DC5 D8A4 58B8. However, I've decided to dedicate another key D8F2 A405 F595 F0B8 96B3  D2CE F7CA DE14 3EE0 7311 for this purpose. This key will expire 02 March 2025. Its rotation history can be viewed @ https://shaffan.dev/rotation.txt.
