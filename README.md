ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website. I am Shaffan Aleem, a second year Computer Science student @ University of Liverpool interested in FOSS + InfoSec/Pentesting & Blockchain technologies.

I prefer all communication to be signed + encrypted to one of <a href="pgp.html">my PGP keys.</a> For convenience, use the PGP key associated with the email address you are contacting. <b>Do not</b> sign + encrypt any messages if the imported key does not match <a href="fingerprints.html">my fingerprints.</a>

This website was built in pure HTML/CSS with zero telemetry. I only use [this script](https://anmolgautam.com/repo-card/repo-card.js) to display my GitHub projects. I do not collect any data from this website. I have no way to anyway.
